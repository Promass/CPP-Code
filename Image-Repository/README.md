# Image-repository

Hello,

I used the pgm type image file becuase it has pixel data in terms of gray values. It was easy to implement and modify. One more reason for choosing this type of file is that I was familiare with adding images to C++. I took a short lesson on how to add images and found out about pgm images. The pgm images cannot be viewed in the regular windows photo viewer. You can use this https://www.irfanview.com/ image viewwer to view pgm images. This link http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html contains information on the format of the pgm images and this link https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/pgma/pgma.html contain pgm format images that can be added to the repository during the demo. Make sure that the new image is in the same file directory as the project or just insert the directory when adding a new image. The program includes several comments to help understand the coding. Although the program seems very primitive, it can be further upgrade in several ways. Thank you for taking the time to review my program.
